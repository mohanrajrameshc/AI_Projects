## Objective

#### Coronavirus that causes a significant respiratory condition. It has resulted in a massive pandemic that has resulted in infected patients and several deaths. Coronavirus becomes mainly transmitted by direct communication with individuals. Motivated by this idea, this study proposes its Survilanance camera-based Artificial Intelligence(AI) method to detect social distancing between peoples. With the YOLOv3 tool, a model deep learning detects approach, Person detection and monitoring have progressed in both interior and exterior environments. The algorithm has used to analyze and describe social space and automatically decide if social distancing laws have followed. As a result, this research aims to help prevent,  The spread of Coronavirus by assessing whether and how persons adhere to social distancing rules. The proposed method has extended through camera-captured videos, To build an entire AI framework for a person's social distancing prediction. The suggested approach has put through its paces cost-effective surveillance cameras. Hierarchical surveillance video cameras are used to visualize several surveillance cameras in a consolidated control system. The findings show that the suggested approach works are appropriate for establishing a surveillance camera infrastructure in cities to identification people for social distancing detection. This technique can also have applied to handheld cameras, such as those installed on the drone system, making drones easier to control and more efficient at capturing observed targets' rapid behaviour from various angles.

## Introduction

#### Coronavirus is now an infection caused by a newly infected disease. Coronavirus had first reported in China in December 2019. The most common Coronavirus (covid-19) symptoms are cough, chills, fever, and difficulty breathing. Aches and pains in the body and a lack of taste and scent COVID-19 is a virus that can be transmitted. It is serious, and in many circumstances, it has resulted in death. Coronavirus is a type of virus. It can be transmitted from a single person to multiple peoples, as determined by libraries and scholars. This pandemic already spreads from over 100 countries. There are 188 countries in the country [1]. On October 15, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) declared that (38,394,169) confirmed COVID-19 cases, And 1089,047 deaths [2] worldwide. 

#### The Coronavirus instability, underlying, and difficulty have rendered predicting the pandemic challenging's length and propagation. Wearing masks and regularly washing hands are necessary preventative measures. When others are ill, an affected person should remain at home to avoid spreading these pandemics to others. This condition compels the international community and policymakers to devise the appropriate prevention strategy to halt coronavirus transmission. Nations ceased operations and closed borders and public spaces such as classrooms and offices to prevent people's experiences. According to reports, The infected countries, That implemented lock-down with their populations saw a decrease in Coronavirus(COVID-19) cases and fatalities as a consequence of this pandemic 

#### According to the World Health Organization, social distancing is now the standard way in which individuals can reduce physical interaction with potential COVID-19 carries by keeping a specific range between one human and another. The primary goal is to provide a systematic tool and efficient technology for enforcing social distancing. Technology solutions have the potential to play a significant role in facilitating social distancing behavior. This challenge has addressed using artificial intelligence (AI) through information and communications technologies (ICT).

#### This study aims to reduce the transmission of this virus in populations and save people's lives. This paper introduces a deep learning object recognition model for person identification on surveillance cameras and an applied algorithm towards social distancing classification.

### 	Experimental results

#### The testing datasets were used to determine the capabilities of detecting and classifying people in the Surveillance camera using the methodology shown in chapter 3. As a result, we used these datasets for our tests. Such Surveillance cameras were subjected to YOLOv3 and distance classification algorithms. The YOLOv3 model people's perceptions and calculates their bounding boxes. Following persons' identification, The measured bounding box is used to quantify the distance between each detectable centroid pair., and the cluster includes a list of (x, y) measurements for each video frame. We then tested the training sample datasets to develop and train R-CNN and Quick R-CNN systems for person detection. Using the same research samples of streaming feeding Videos and recorded videos as shown in fig 4,

### 	Conclusion

#### In outdoor spaces, maintaining a protected space between one person and another is essential. To avoid covid19, stay at least 6 feet (more than 2 arm lengths) away from other people in both indoor and outdoor environments to exercise social distancing. Based on live feeding recordings, this study implied an intelligent detection system for monitoring individuals and detecting social distancing. Compared to different deep learning techniques, the proposed methodology generated positive results for people tracking to evaluate the detector's accuracy and consistency. A special algorithm was introduced on input vectors to differentiate between certain and dangerous situations, labelling the line segment for detected individuals as green or red, respectively. The suggested method to apply in a remote video monitoring scheme is an effective way for officials to monitor social distancing compliance.
